# Romania-A-Algorithm
Romania Problem with A*, BFS, and DFS Algorithms - Intro to AI Class Homework at Florida Atlantic University

Changes to the original:

-- The list of cites are now displayed at the beginning for reference

-- If the user still enters the departure city that's not on the map/list, they'll get prompted with the list of cities and asked to enter the city name again

-- Both BFS and DFS algorithms are implemented

-- The user now can choose one of the algorithms (A*, BFS, and DFS) to calculate the path from starting point to the destination (Bucharest)

-- The details of the calculated paths are now displayed

-- The user will get asked if
   they want to enter another city of departure

-- Code has been edited so that the output
   is more visually pleasing

How to use the Romania.py file:

-- In order for the program to run appropriately, it has to be in the same directory as the following 2 text files: romania.txt (Cities with their respective distances from Bucharest) and romania_sld.txt (Cities with edges)
